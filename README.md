</h> Detecting Strange Parent-Child Relationships </h>
<h2>Description</h2>
In standard Windows environments, certain processes never call or spawn others. For example, it is unlikely to see "calc.exe" spawning "cmd.exe" in a normal Windows environment. Understanding these relationships can help to detect anomalies.
<h2>Utilities Used</h2>
</p>- Process Hacker</p>
</p>- Event Tracing for Windows</p>
<h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>
</p> We can use Process Hacker to explore parent-child relationships within Windows. Sorting the processes by dropdowns in the Processes view reveals a hierarchical representation of the relationships.</p>

</p> Analyzing these relationships enables us to identify deviations from normal patterns. For example, if we observe the "spoolsv.exe" process creating "whoami.exe" instead of its expected behavior of creating a "conhost", it raises suspicion.
</p> To simulate an abnormal parent-child relationship where "cmd.exe" appears to be created by "spoolsv.exe" with no accompanying arguments, we will utilize an attacking technique called Parent PID Spoofing. This will falsify the PPID of the current executable to be that of any arbitrary process accessible to the current user </p>
